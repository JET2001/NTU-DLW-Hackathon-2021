#### Intuition for the iOS Application
This mobile application consist of three main pages: 
1) About CHD - This section would give you more precise information regarding CHD and its prevalance in our society. More importantly, it also provides details on what you should do if you're at risk. 

2) Accessible Detection Algorithm to check if they are facing an immediate risk to the disease. This uses a machine learning classifier, given input data from a single data, combined with the most recent health screening records, one can have a handy device to check if they are susceptible to the disease. 

3) Lifestyle Assessment as a method for data collection. The sole purpose of this interface is to create an easily accessible, local, and recent dataset, and can potentially establish correlations between lifestyle and wellbeing and the probability that it can lead to an increase risk of Coronary Heart Disease. This could potentially lead to more research in the prevention against CHD in the long run.
