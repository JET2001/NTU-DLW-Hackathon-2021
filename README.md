# NTU-DLW-Hackathon-2021: Machine Learning Application for early detection of Coronary Heart Disease

### Reflection
<em>(MY FIRST HACKATHON!!)</em>

I was actually at a loss of what to do I must say. Less than 48 hours, a machine learning based solution? 
Then I started watching videos on what projects are cool to do in 2021. I landed on Parkinsons disease, which I 
found after a while a little tough to expand upon and come up with something more substantial, other than its 
early prediction (which many people have done before). So I chose one that was pretty close to home, because I've had
a couple family members suffer from Ischaemic Heart Disease. Ischaemic heart disease was trickier than Prkinsons, because of the lac of noticeable symptoms and its sudden nature. 

I also wanted a more local focus, and coronary heart disease (CHD) is also to be a leading cause of death in Singapore. I have a slight interest in medicine and mortality from the books that I read from doctors, and yeah so this was my cause for the machine learning application. 
I toiled on this over the two days, and now that as I write this reflection I have been awake for 26 hours, and irregardless of
the outcome, I feel that this hackathon is a pretty interesting way to throw yourself into the deep end and try to impress yourself
by exceeding yourself.

Will probably go for more hackathons in the future. Thank you NTU's EEE for the virgin experience!
